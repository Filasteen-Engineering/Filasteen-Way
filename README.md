Filasteen Way is a social media banking app for the Palestinian people that's powered by Nostr - a new decentralized protocol that enables truly open, censorship-resistant communication.

- Nostr uses ultra-secure cryptographic key technology that can't be compromised.

- 100% anonymous.  we don't require any of your personal data such as email(s) or phone number(s).

- Follow users with a familiar Twitter UI people have come to expect.

- You own your data - we keep BIG TECH out of your life.

- No one can manipulate posts you see or share with followers.

- Receive Bitcoin from anyone in the world with built-in support for Lightning Addresses. (ex: you@filasteen.me)


It's the easiest way to start accepting Bitcoin for payments without having to be online all the time.
